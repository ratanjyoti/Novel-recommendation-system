# Novel-recommendation-system
There are countless novels available on the internet, offering a rich and diverse collection of stories 
from various genres and authors. However, the recommendations you often encounter tend to highlight only 
the most famous and popular titles, leaving many hidden gems undiscovered. Recognizing this gap, I have
developed a personalized novel recommendation system designed to cater to your unique reading preferences.

 Our recommendation system goes beyond the usual bestsellers and critically acclaimed works. By analyzing
 your individual tastes and interests, it curates a tailored list of books that align with your personal 
 preferences. Whether you're into contemporary fiction, historical novels, fantasy epics, or niche genres,
 this system ensures that you discover novels that resonate with you.

publiser and number of reader read that book.
2.User interest collection:
When you first use the system, it collects information as to what type of book you read and some books as to what type of book you like.
3. Recommandation Algorithm:

1.Content based filtering:
